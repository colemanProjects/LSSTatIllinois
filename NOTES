server-status test:
	- test whether the apache server is set up correctly and mod_fastcgi is installed
	- type url to server base directory with 'server-status' appended at the end
		e.g:	if the public server is 'lsst.cs.illinois.edu'
			type 'lsst.cs.illinois.edu/server-status' into a browser
		result:	It should say Apache Server Status for lsst.cs.illinois.edu in bold
			under that you may see "Server Version:Apache/2....."
			on the same line as "Server Version:" youshould see something about
			mod_fastcgi. It's common to see php and it's version as well.
