This server is a prototype for a web version of the astronautical viewing software 'ds9'.
It is being written as an open source tool for use on the LSST Visualization team.
It currently features smooth panning and zooming on input images as well as color contrast adjustment. 
The server display system makes use of the IIpimage gigapixel viewer. (found at iipimage.sourceforge.net)

********************************* Implementation *********************************
The server system is written in a combination of html + php,javascript, and python.
In general, it is composed of a sidebar on the right, a footer at the bottom, a menu bar for navigating, and a central frame (iframe) for displaying the image. 
The image in the central frame is typically displayed using a tiled tiff format with blocksize 256x256.
PHP:
php is used for file upload and the web page layout. 
index.php - the main page for lsst.cs.illinois.edu
style.css - the stylesheet for lsst.cs.illinois.edu (used within index.php)
upload_file.php - script for uploading files
uploadPage.html - page allowing users to upload images that are stored in the central frame
histogram.html  - page that displays the histogram data for the image in the central frame
includes/  - includes all php files used for the main page
testdir/  - directory storing files used for testing during development
pics/	  - directory storing pics used for development
uploads/  - directory storing the most current uploaded images. Used by code pertaining to central frame image
uploads_backup/ - directory storing backup files for the uploads directory. e.g. Default pics to display

python:
fitsToTiff.py - converts fits images to tiled Tiff Images
gethistogram.py - returns the color histogram for pixels in an image

javascript:
fcgi-bin - directory where the iipimage server is run for viewing the central frame image
d3	 - javascript library for displaying histograms
iipmooviewer-1.1/ - directory storing code for the iipmooviewer(client) for the central frame image.

********************************* USE *********************************
The client would simpy visit lsst.cs.illinois.edu in a browser.
The client would upload an image of their choosing (png,tiled tiff, fits,jpg, or giff). 
The image would then be displayed in the central frame on the page. 
Zooming can be done by clicking the '+' button on the mini navigation window inoside the central from, overlayed on the image. 
Panning can be done by clicking and dragging the image itself.
The color contrast can be changed by sliding the grey bar on the bottom of the image to the left or right. 

********************************* ENHANCEMENT *********************************
There are many more features to be improved and added. 
1. The image is currently stored in an intermediate step as a png image. This causes loss in color depth. 
2. The color contrast bar needs a better location. It currently hides a portion of the image
3. The color contrast bar needs to allow a smooth and gradual contrast change instead of sticking 
4. The histogram feature currently does not display a proper histogram
5. Many other additional features will come into play later!
